# unix-utilities
the project focuses upon writing simple C programs, On a few different UNIX utilities, simple versions of commonly used commands like cat, ls, etc.
#Objectives:
* Re-familiarize yourself with the C programming language
* Re-familiarize yourself with a shell / terminal / command-line of UNIX
* Learn how to use a proper code editor (likw vscode ,etc..)
* Learn a little about how UNIX utilities are implemented
Summary of what gets turned in:
* A bunch of single .c files for each of the utilities
* Each should compile successfully when compiled with the **-Wall** and
**-Werror** flags.
* Each should (hopefully) pass the tests we supply to you.
